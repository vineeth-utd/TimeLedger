# TimeLedger

A private, authenticated web application for tracking, organizing, and analyzing personal time.

TimeLedger was originally built to replace my Google Sheets based time tracking workflow and has evolved into a full-stack application that I use daily to log activities, manage categories, set weekly targets, and analyze how my time is spent.

The application is designed with a strong focus on fast activity logging, meaningful analytics, and a clean user experience across desktop and mobile.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure the following are installed:

- Node.js 20+
- npm
- PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- Git

---

### Installation

DATABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
```

Where:

- `DATABASE_URL` → Supabase Session Pooler connection string
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` → Supabase Project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` → Supabase Publishable (Anon) Key

---

### Database

Generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

---

### Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### Production

The production application is deployed on Vercel.

Deployment requires:

- Vercel
